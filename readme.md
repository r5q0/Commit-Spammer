# Commit Spammer

üöÄ A script to spam your Git commits and annoy your teammates! ü§£

## Description

This script is designed to add a file with 500 lines, commit it, push it to the remote repository, and then remove the file. It repeats this process in an infinite loop with a specified delay between each step.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/commit-spammer.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd commit-spammer
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    php index.php
    ```

    The script will start spamming commits with a delay of 3 seconds between each step. Feel free to modify the delay according to your needs.
